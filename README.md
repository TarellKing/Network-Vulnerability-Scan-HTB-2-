# Network Vulnerability Scan (HTB #2)

During this lab , I conducted a port scan on a virtual machine (VM) to uncover potential security weaknesses. Through my meticulous examination, I discovered a vulnerability residing within port 445 which is home of the server message block
. Harnessing my knowledge, I  employed a series of commands to infiltrate the server, capitalizing on the weakness exposed by port 445.

Once inside, I navigated through the workgroup directory. Using my knowledge of system architecture and directory structures, I artfully uncovered files ensconced within a specific directory.

In conclusion, conducting network scans on oneself and ensuring that outdated protocols are not in use is a fundamental aspect of maintaining a secure and resilient network environment. By staying vigilant and proactive in addressing vulnerabilities, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce the risk of potential attacks and protect sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands.

Key Contributions:

○ Conducted a comprehensive port scan on a virtual machine, revealing the vulnerability of port 445.

○ EUtilized advanced command-line techniques to gain access to the server through the identified vulnerable port.

○ Navigated through the workgroup environment, effectively locating and accessing specific files stored within a directory.
